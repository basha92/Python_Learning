#this text file is about branching concepts in git. already some comments are added back in the merge git pycharm file.
# List my branches
git branch or git branch -a
#get all changes done in web to local
git pull
#create a new branch
git branch <branch name>
#push it to remote
git push -u origin <branch name>

#after any command if the terminal shows : press q to quit.
#to work on the project,
git checkout <branch name>
while switching between the branches, the pushed through the branch only will appear. others won't. To make it visible, merge with main.
git merge <branch name> - provide the other name than the one you are currently on.
#if you are in main, give sub branch name, not give main.
