A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. 
In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes 
before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. 
Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in 
the source branch and the content in the target branch.

In simple terms, pull request is for asking a review on the changes done on 
different branch, approve it and merge it to the main branch.
process:
do the changes in different branch
add the changes using git add . or git add (file name).
commit them using git commit -m "commit message"

Pull request is basically used by the user who don't have access to the main branch to do the changes.
After commiting the code, push it to the created branch using git push origin branch_name.
Go to the git website, click on the pull request tab and create a new pull request.
We can compare the difference in the changes by comparing the main and created branch.
Add the required comit message and click on create pull request. 
Now admin of the main branch can see the pull request using his login, review the request and merge it to the main.
After that, all the changes from new branch will be merged to the main branch.
